This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

then create a file named .env 
you can use .env.example to see the variable that you need

now you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Test
```bash
$ npm run test
# or
$ yarn run test
```

also you can use docker instead , just simply run this command in your terminal
```bash
$ docker compose up
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
